How do we fall in love
Harder than a bullet could hit ya?
How do we fall apart
Faster than a hair pin trigger?

Don't you say, don't you say it
Don't say, don't you say it
One breath, it'll just break it
So shut your mouth and run me like a river

Shut your mouth, baby stand and deliver
Holy hands, ooh they make me a sinner
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
